# Previous Version
Cloud Nine 2.0 is heavily modified from a previous version. The previous version can be [viewed live here](https://cl0udnine.herokuapp.com/). While changes were solely designed and engineered on my own, the previous version of Cloud Nine was engineered in conjuction with [a team of contributors](https://github.com/team-myrel/cl0udnine) and through the use of a boilerplate.
